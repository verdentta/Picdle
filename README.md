To run this file, you need to have JDK/JRE folder copied into the project folder. 
The current JDK I'm using is JDK-22. Copy the contents of the JDK into a separate folder and rename it as "JRE"
Copy that folder and paste it into the project folder and launch the executable. 


If you don't know where your JDK folder is, it's usually in the C drive -> Program Files -> Java -> jdk-[version]. Go into that folder, copy the contents, and paste it into the JRE folder you made in the project folder.
