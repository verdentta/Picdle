To run this file, you need to have JDK/JRE folder copied into the project folder. 
The current JDK I'm using is JDK-22. Copy the contents of the JDK into the"JRE" folder of the project folder.



If you don't know where your JDK folder is, it's usually in the C drive -> Program Files -> Java -> jdk-[version]. Go into that folder, copy the contents, and paste it into the JRE folder of the project folder and run the executable.
